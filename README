This script eases development of vim scripts that use embedded perl code by automatically adding or updating line directives to perl code blocks.  So for example:

     perl <<EOF

will automagicall become

     perl <<EOF
     # line 42 /some/file.vim

when you save /some/file.vim.

Now your error messages that come from perl will have correct file names and line numbers.

See also http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3411 if you want to automatically catch perl syntax errors when vim scripts are saved.
